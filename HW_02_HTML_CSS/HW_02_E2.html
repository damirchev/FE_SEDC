    <h1>Linked Data</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><small>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</small></p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In computing,<strong> linked data </strong> (often capitalized as <strong>Linked Data</strong>) is structured
        data which is interlinked with other data
        so it becomes more useful through <a href="">semantic queries</a>. It builds upon standard <a href="">Web</a>
        technologies such as HTTP, RDF and
        URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages only for human readers, it extends them to share information
        in
        a way that can be read automatically by computers. Part of the vision of linked data is for the Internet to
        become a
        global database. <sup>[1]</sup></p>

    <p> <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, <abbr title="Director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)">W3C</abbr>,
        coined the term in a 2006 design note about the
        Semantic Web project. <sup>[2]</sup></p>

    <p> Linked data may also be open data, in which case it is usually described as <strong>linked open data
            (LOD)</strong>. <sup>[3]</sup></p>

    <h2>Principles</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        In his 2006 <q>Linked Data</q> note, Tim Berners-Lee outlined four principles of linked data, paraphrased along
        the following lines: <sup>[2]</sup>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) should be used to name and identify individual things.
        </li>
        <li>
            HTTP URIs should be used to allow these things to be looked up, interpreted, and subsequently
            <q>dereferenced</q>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Useful information about what a name identifies should be provided through open standards such as RDF,
            SPARQL, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            When publishing data on the Web, other things should be referred to using their HTTP URI-based names.
        </li>
    </ol>
    Tim Berners-Lee later restated these principles at a 2009 TED conference, again paraphrased along the following:
    <sup>[4]</sup>
    <ol>
        <li>
            All conceptual things should have a name starting with HTTP.
        </li>
        <li>
            Looking up an HTTP name should return useful data about the thing in question in a standard format.
        </li>
        <li>
            Anything else that that same thing has a relationship with through its data should also be given a name
            beginning with HTTP.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Linked open data</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <strong>Linked open data</strong> is linked data that is open data. <sup>[5][6][7]</sup> Tim Berners-Lee gives
        the clearest definition of linked open data in differentiation with linked data.
    <blockquote>
        <dl>
            <dt>
                Linked Open Data (LOD) is Linked Data which is released under an open license, which does not impede its
                reuse for free.

                — Tim Berners-Lee, Linked Data
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </blockquote>
    Large linked open data sets include DBpedia and Wikidata.
    </p>

    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>
        The term <q>linked open data</q> has been in use since at least February 2007, when the <q>Linking Open Data</q>
        mailing list <sup>[9]</sup> was created. <sup> [10]</sup>
        The mailing list was initially hosted by the SIMILE project <sup>[11]</sup> at the Massachusetts Institute of
        Technology.
    </p>


    <h4>Linking Open Data community project</h4>
    <p>
        The goal of the W3C Semantic Web Education and Outreach group's Linking Open Data community project is to extend
        the Web with a data commons by publishing various open datasets as RDF on the Web and by setting RDF links
        between data items from different data sources. In October 2007, datasets consisted of over two billion RDF
        triples, which were interlinked by over two million RDF links.[13][14] By September 2011 this had grown to 31
        billion RDF triples, interlinked by around 504 million RDF links. A detailed statistical breakdown was published
        in 2014.
    </p>

    <h4>European Union projects</h4>
    <p>
        There are a number of European Union projects involving linked data. These include the linked open data around
        the clock (LATC) project, the PlanetData project, the DaPaaS (Data-and-Platform-as-a-Service)
        project, and the Linked Open Data 2 (LOD2) project. Data linking is one of the main goals of the
        EU Open Data Portal, which makes available thousands of datasets for anyone to reuse and link.
    </p>

    <h4>Ontologies</h4>
    <p>
        Ontologies are formal descriptions of data structures. Some of the better known ontologies are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOAF_(ontology)">FOAF</a>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                       - an ontology describing persons, their properties and relationships
                    </dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMBEL">UMBEL</a>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        – a lightweight reference structure of 20,000 subject concept classes and their relationships derived from OpenCyc, which can act as binding classes to external data; also has links to 1.5 million named entities from DBpedia and YAGO
                    </dd>
                </dl>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Datasets</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBpedia">DBpedia</a> – a dataset containing extracted data from Wikipedia; it contains about 3.4 million concepts described by 1 billion triples, including abstracts in 11 different languages
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoNames">GeoNames</a> – provides RDF descriptions of more than 7,500,000 geographical features worldwide.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata">Wikidata</a> – a collaboratively-created linked dataset that acts as central storage for the structured data of its Wikimedia Foundation sister projects
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Research_Identifier_Database">Global Research Identifier Database</a> (<em>GRID</em>) – an international database of 89,506 institutions engaged in academic research, with 14,401 relationships, models two types of relationships: a parent-child relationship that defines a subordinate association, and a related relationship that describes other associations
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Dataset instance and class relationships</h4>
    <p>
        Clickable diagrams that show the individual datasets and their relationships within the DBpedia-spawned LOD cloud (as shown by the figures to the right) are available.

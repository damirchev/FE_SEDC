<html> 
    <!-- In the main html container, element relationship is established -->
    <head>
        <!-- head element is child of the html element -->
        <title>
            My first HTML structure
            <!-- Title is grand-child of html, but child of head -->
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- same principle applies to body -->
